# Linguistic Stratification and Vulnerability Detection

EAGER: Effective Detection of Vulnerabilities and Linguistic Stratification in Open Source Software

NSF award #1445079  

This project is a collaboration between computer scientists (software engineering) and social scientists (linguistics) to develop a new interdisciplinary approach to address issues in cybersecurity. Code can be made more secure if the developers that may be more likely to inadvertently introduce a vulnerability in a program can be somewhow identified early (their code contributions to Open Source Software (OSS) projects can be given high priority by security experts checking the program). Our hypothesis is that those _high risk_ developers will display a pattern of linguistic behavior (in their use of both natural language and code) that is very different from that of more seasoned (and therefore _low risk_) developers. Detection of those linguistic patterns can then be used to evaluate the risk level of a developer compared to others in the same project.
