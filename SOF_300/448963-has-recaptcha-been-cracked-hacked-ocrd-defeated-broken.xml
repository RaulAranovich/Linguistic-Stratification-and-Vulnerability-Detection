<post><title>security - Has reCaptcha been cracked / hacked / OCR'd / defeated / broken? - Stack Overflow</title><question><text><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have any programming methods have been used to defeat reCAPTCHA?</p>
<p>I'm interested in seeing evidence and potentially demonstrations that reCAPTCHA in particular has been made obsolete by completely automated, humanless methods.</p>
<p>To clarify, <strong>not</strong> looking for reCAPTCHA-cheating solutions that involve humans in any way, whether teams tasked with filling out CAPCHAs, porn-seekers, or Mechanical Turk.</p>
<p>I'm also <strong>not</strong> looking for alternatives to reCAPTCHA, like picking the type of animal, or background fields or javascript trickery.</p>

<p>I notice that almost all the answers here relate to the ineffectiveness of the <em>concept</em> of CAPTCHA, in principle - and while I very much agree with them, in fact gave a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2008_Conference" rel="noreferrer">talk at OWASP</a> a few months ago <a href="http://www.owasp.org/images/6/66/2008-09-14_OWASP_Israel_2008.ppt" rel="noreferrer">explaining just that</a> - the question is very specific, so I will provide for a demonstration.<br/>
But first, I will reiterate that demonstration aside, re-read the other comments, since it's truth that CAPTCHA is pointless and not helpful, irrelevant of implementation....</p>
<p>But really, check out <a href="http://www.captchakiller.com/" rel="noreferrer">CAPTCHA Killer</a>. You can upload a CAPTCHA image, and it will automatically, if not immediately, provide the OCR'd answer. It also provides for an API (REST, I think, but maybe also SOAP). I personally tried numerous reCAPTCHA images, and it was actually some of the easiest ones (or at least quickest) broken. </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: CAPTCHA Killer's website is now taken down, apparently under legal pressure.  See <a href="http://captcha.org/" rel="noreferrer">http://captcha.org/</a> for a complete overview of the topic.</p>
<p>And yeah, OCR is not the best way to break a CAPTCHA protected site - there are many other better ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hacking Recaptcha (aka ‘The Penis Flood’)</p>
<p>The next tactic used was to see if they could find a flaw in the reCAPTCHA implementation.  One thing they discovered about reCAPTCHA was that it always presents two words to a user for decoding - one word is a control word known by the reCAPTCHA system, while the other is an unknown  word (reCAPTCHA uses the humans to help correct OCR errors).  Wikipedia describes the process: “Scanned text is subjected to analysis by two different optical character recognition programs; in cases where the programs disagree, the questionable word is converted into a CAPTCHA. The word is displayed along with a control word already known and is labeled by the human.  Those words that are consistently given a single label by human judges are recycled as control words”. 2iasdo4 What Anonymous realized was that if they always labeled the unknown scanned text with the same word - and if they did this thousands and thousands of times eventually a large percentage of the unknown words would be mislabeled with their word. All they had to do was look at the two words in the captcha, enter the proper label for the ‘easy’ one (presumably that would be the one that the two optical scanners would agree upon) and enter the word “penis” for the hard one.  If they did this often enough, then soon a significant percentage of the images would be labeled as ‘penis’ and the ability to autovote would be restored (one side effect, that was not lost on Anonymous, was the notion that for years to come there would be a number of  digital books with  the word ‘penis’ randomly inserted throughout the text.    Update: I asked Ben Maurer, chief engineer of reCAPTCHA about this ‘penis flood‘ attack, Ben says that they’ve anticipated this type of attack and they have numerous protections that will keep the penises from penetrating the reCAPTCHA barrier.</p>
<p>Optimizing reCAPTCHA</p>
<p>As appealing as the notion of sprinkling the word ‘penis’ into texts, the Anonymous team knew that the clock was ticking, and if they were going to restore the Message they didn’t have time to wait for the autovoters to come back online - they were going to have to vote manually, many, many times. And so they needed to be able to enter captcha’s as fast as they could. They developed a set of guidelines that allowed them to quickly decide which reCAPTCHA words they could skip. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will be given 2 words: 1 real, 1 fake.</p>
<p>For <code>[REAL FAKE]</code> or <code>[FAKE REAL]</code>, you can just type in <code>REAL</code> and it should be accepted.</p>
<p>If it’s <code>[LOOKSREAL LOOKSREAL]</code> or <code>[LOOKSFAKE LOOKSFAKE]</code>, it’s usually just quicker to just type in both words.  Don’t waste precious time deciding which one of them is real.</p>
<p>Use both the appearance and the type of word to identify a fake
      word.  Don’t rely on just one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole ruleset is here: <a href="http://musicmachinery.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/fakecaptcha2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">fake captcha</a>.</p>

<p>The weakness of CAPTCHA systems is that people set up rooms full of people in China whose only job it is is to look at a CAPTCHA image and type in the result, which plugs into the automated system that's actually doing the spamming.</p>
<p>Not much you can do about that really.</p>
<p>It's also far cheaper than trying to do image recognition, OCR, etc on the actual image (you may get a response for under $0.01 the other way).</p>

<p>Before giving in to the pressure of using captcha, consider creative workarounds such as having a field labeled "Your Comments" that is hidden by CSS. If the field is entered, the request is dropped by the server. Most bots will fall for it even if there is still not a good way to defeat the room full of underpaid laborers, which captcha does not help with anyways.</p>

<p>reCAPTACHA isn't broken and it won't be for a very long time. The thing is, if you implement your own captcha if it's broken, it probably takes a long time to fix it.</p>
<p>This is taken from the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/security.html" rel="noreferrer">page about reCAPTCHA security</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reCAPTCHA is a Web service. That means
  that all the images are generated and
  graded by our servers. (…) this also
  provides an extra level of protection:
  our CAPTCHAs can be automatically
  updated whenever a security
  vulnerability is found.</p>
<p><em>For example, if somebody writes a program that can read our distorted
  images, we can add more distortions in
  very little time, <strong>and without Web
  masters having to change anything on

<p>I believe as they are specialized on captchas they have improved versions stored, ready to be deployed in little time if needed. (Why should they create stronger security when the weaker isn't broken yet?)</p>

<p>Not only has it been defeated, but also <a href="http://jdownloader.org/download" rel="noreferrer">a useful application</a> has been successfully built on top of it, to become the most amazing tool to defeat all kind of free-account protections of a big list of direct download sites (not only megaupload and rapidshare). </p>
<p><a href="http://jdownloader.org/download" rel="noreferrer">Jdownloader</a> is open source and written in Java so a peek at the <a href="https://www.syncom.org/svn/jdownloader/" rel="noreferrer">source code</a> can answer not only <strong>if it is broken</strong> but also <strong>how</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Most of direct download sites do not use reCaptcha, but a simpler Captcha method (3 capital letters colored in different colors). Nonetheless Jdownloader and <a href="http://cryptload.info/" rel="noreferrer">Cryptload</a> (a program similar to Jdownloader) are the only working implementations that I know that effectively have broken a Captcha method. I have not heard of any implementation to crack reCaptcha.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems that at least one implementation of reCaptcha (not whole reCaptcha itself) <a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/" rel="noreferrer">has been cracked too</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update Dec 2010</strong>: Jdownloader <a href="http://jdownloader.org/news/blog/x20101106-135631recaptcha-anticaptcha-method" rel="noreferrer">seems at last to be defeating reCaptcha</a>. The plugin is still experimental and works only on Windows versions of Jdownloader, but, as I have been told by a mate who tried it, it does work.</p>

<p>There was <a href="http://captchatalk.com/" rel="noreferrer">a speech at Defcon last year</a> that went into the problems with CAPTCHAs in general. One of the things they did is use multiple free OCR engines and had them vote on the best words. Doing this, they were able to achieve a somewhat decent chance of succeeding.  For one kind, it was 40% or so, I don't think it was reCaptcha, though.</p>

<p>2-3 years ago the text-typing based captchas approach trespassed the line when they lost its battle, i.e. further complications just make them relatively (since computer power is increasing, while human's not) easier for machines and more repugnant and repelling, if not completely impossible, to humans.

<p>I'm seeing blog comments on a system protected by reCAPTCHA where the page loads and 1 second later the post was made successfully. The User-Agent was nonsense (in this particular case it claimed to be running Ubuntu 9.25/Firefox 3.8), the referrer was from a completely unrelated site with no link to us.</p>
<p>This is clearly automated.</p>

<p>reCAPTCHA has not been defeated. If it had been, then why did Google just buy it and announce they will be applying the technology within Google to increase fraud and spam protection for Google products?</p>
<p>from <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/09/16/google-acquires-recaptcha/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Acquires reCAPTCHA</a> posted to the Google Blog on 9/16/09:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this way, reCAPTCHA’s unique technology improves the process that converts scanned images into plain text, known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This technology also powers large scale text scanning projects like Google Books and Google News Archive Search. Having the text version of documents is important because plain text can be searched, easily rendered on mobile devices and displayed to visually impaired users. So we'll be applying the technology within Google not only to increase fraud and spam protection for Google products but also to improve our books and newspaper scanning process.</p>

<p>The easiest way to defeat Captchas is Amazon Mechanical Turk.  There's a guy named Kermit Welda who pays people a nickel each to register Hotmail, AOL and Gmail accounts.  That's 6,000 fake email accounts at 5 cents = $300 a day.  The cost of doing business is pretty cheap when you have other people do the dirty work for you.  No wonder our server's spam filters want to reject anything from Hotmail.</p>

<p>AFAIK In practice there is no tool to crack RE-captcha implementation, however eventually I assume someone will get it.</p>
<p>Funny enough if someone manages to get it then the whole RE-captcha project is pointless because re-captcha designed digitalize books which can't be done in an automated way. </p>
<p>BTW : </p>

<p>You can't secure a system thinking like that, this is like saying "your web application is not secure enough if your host is not in a old military bunker, because now people can steal your machine".</p>

Or as I often say "CAPTCHA (in general) is a bad solution to the wrong problem."     The problem CAPTCHA tries to solve (by definition) is: How do I know that the user is a person, not a computer? Whether or not CAPTCHA solves this (it doesnt), the REAL problem is: How can I prevent mass flooding of my service?    CAPTCHA farms and proxies show the exact difference.

<p>There are lots of methods that are used to crap recaptcha. While its hard to use neural netwpork enabled programs to automatically solve them, its possible to grab the image and have amazon's mechanical turk or some equivalent program to solve them.</p>
