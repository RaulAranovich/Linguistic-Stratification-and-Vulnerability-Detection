<post><title>http - Why am I suddenly getting a "Blocked loading mixed active content" issue in Firefox? - Stack Overflow</title><question><text><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This morning, upon upgrading my Firefox browser to the latest version (from 22 to 23), some of the key aspects of my back office (website) stopped working.</p>
<p>Looking at the Firebug log, the following errors were being reported:</p>
<pre><code>Blocked loading mixed active content "http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.10/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css"
Blocked loading mixed active content "http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.8.10/jquery-ui.min.js"`
</code></pre>
<p>among other errors caused by the latter of the two above not being loaded.</p>
<p>What does the above mean and how do I resolve it?</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2013/04/10/mixed-content-blocking-enabled-in-firefox-23/">this blog post</a> which cleared up a few things. To quote the most relevant bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mixed Active Content is now blocked by default in Firefox 23!</p>
<p><strong>What is Mixed Content?</strong><br/>
  When a user visits a page served over HTTP, their connection is open for eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. When a user visits a page served over HTTPS, their connection with the web server is authenticated and encrypted with SSL and hence safeguarded from eavesdroppers and MITM attacks.</p>
<p>However, if an HTTPS page includes HTTP content, the HTTP portion can be read or modified by attackers, even though the main page is served over HTTPS.  When an HTTPS page has HTTP content, we call that content “mixed”. The webpage that the user is visiting is only partially encrypted, since some of the content is retrieved unencrypted over HTTP.  The Mixed Content Blocker blocks certain HTTP requests on HTTPS pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resolution, in my case, was to simply ensure the <code>jquery</code> includes were as follows (note the removal of the protocol):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.10/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.8.10/jquery-ui.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note that the temporary 'fix' is to click on the 'shield' icon in the top-left corner of the address bar and select 'Disable Protection on This Page', although this is <strong>not</strong> recommended for obvious reasons.</em></p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-content-isnt-secure-affect-my-safety">This link</a> from the Firefox (Mozilla) support pages is also useful in explaining what constitutes mixed content and, as given in the above paragraph, does actually provide details of how to display the page regardless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most websites will continue to work normally without any action on your part.</p>
<p>If you need to allow the mixed content to be displayed, you can do that easily:</p>
<p>Click the shield icon Mixed Content Shield in the address bar and choose Disable Protection on This Page from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>The icon in the address bar will change to an orange warning triangle Warning Identity Icon to remind you that insecure content is being displayed. </p>
<p>To revert the previous action (re-block mixed content), just reload the page.</p>

As it was, people had no choice about what sites were blocked if they left the feature enabled. If you explicitly unblocked a site it would be blocked the next time you refreshed the page. If you were a developer having to work in mixed-mode it was very frustrating and you ended turning it off.

<p>It means you're calling http from https. You can use <code>src="//url.to/script.js"</code> in your script tag and it will auto-detect.</p>
<p>Alternately you can use use https in your <code>src</code> even if you will be publishing it to a http page. This will avoid the potential issue mentioned in the comments.</p>

<p>In absence of a white-list feature you have to make the "all" or "nothing" Choice. You can disable mixed content blocking completely.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>The Nothing Choice</strong></p>
<p>You will need to permanently disable mixed content blocking for the current active profile.</p>
<p>In the "Awesome Bar," type "about:config".  If this is your first time you will get the "This might void your warranty!" message. </p>
<p>Yes you will be careful. Yes you promise!</p>
<p>Find <strong>security.mixed_content.block_active_content</strong>. Set its value to <strong>false</strong>.  </p>

<p><strong>The All Choice</strong></p>

<p>If you are consuming an internal service via AJAX, make sure the url points to https, this cleared up the error for me.</p>
<p>Initial AJAX URL: "<a href="http://XXXXXX.com/Core.svc/">http://XXXXXX.com/Core.svc/</a>" + ApiName <br/>

<p>Its given the error because of security.
for this please use "https" not "http" in the website url.</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<pre><code>   "https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.10/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css"
   "https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.8.10/jquery-ui.min.js"

<p>I had this same problem because I bought a CSS template and it grabbed a javascript an external javascript file through <code>http://whatever.js.com/javascript.js</code>. I went to that page in my browser and then changed it to <code>https://whatever...</code> using SSL and it worked, so in my HTML javascript tag I just changed the URL to use <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code> and it worked.</p>

<p>To force redirect on https protocol, you can also add this directive in .htaccess on root folder</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_SCHEME} =http

RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</code></pre>
