<post><title>security - Strange MySQL Popup "Mysql Installer is running community mode" - Stack Overflow</title><question><text><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have recently installed a recent community version of MySQL from MySQL site. The version is 5.6.x.</p>
<p>It was done using an installer and I also chose the option to create a MySQL service on Windows so that I can simply start the service. The service was set to not start automatically. </p>
<p>Although I am not actively using MySQL, while I am working on my PC on something else, a strange pop-up displays, "MySQL Running in community mode.", does something, prints on screen, and closes:</p>
<p><img alt="MySql installer" src="https://i.imgur.com/O8rGcrw.png"/></p>
<p>I am surprised to see this and wonder: what is it doing - connecting to a remote server and doing what? Does someone know the internals and how to prevent it from connecting to a remote server?</p>
<p>Could this be a security issue?</p>

<p>Since the other answers require OS interaction I figured it would be beneficial to provide the "MySQL" way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am surprised to see and wonder what is it doing and connecting to a
  remote server and doing what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's keeping the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installer/en/mysql-installer-catalog.html" rel="noreferrer">MySQL Product Catalog</a> up to date. As described in the documentation, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This option uses the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a task named
  "ManifestUpdate". <em>(this is the scheduled task that is disabled the OS way)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does someone know the internals and how to prevent it from connecting
  to a remote server?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prevent it from connecting you can disable it without going through the OS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the MySQL installer</li>
<li>Click the wrench image</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lA3RE.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Uncheck the checkbox to disable automatic updating</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vyD2f.png"/></p>
<p>You're ready to go...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This could be a security issue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not a security expert but it's connecting to the same people you trusted to get the software from so I think it's more of a nuisance than a risk. </p>
<p>Luckily, you can manually update it as needed by clicking the <code>Catalog...</code> button seen above and force it.</p>

<p>It's just the MySQL update function.</p>
<p>Following these <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/what-is-taskengexe/526f43d3-d311-4637-a19a-a76f1ce351fb">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/what-is-taskengexe/526f43d3-d311-4637-a19a-a76f1ce351fb</a> you should be able to turn it off:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Start menu.</li>
<li>Type task scheduler and press enter.</li>
<li>Press continue on the UAC popup.</li>
<li>In the left pane of task scheduler, underneath Task Scheduler Local, right-click on Task Scheduler Library.</li>
<li>In the View submenu, make sure the Show Hidden Tasks option is checked.</li>
<li>Widen the Name column in the center pane. The hidden task that is likely at fault has a name that starts with User_Feed_Synchronization,
  followed by a dash and a bunch of digits inside a curly brace.</li>
<li>Select that task in the middle pane by clicking on its name.</li>
<li>To verify that this scheduled task is creating all those taskeng.exe processes, select the History tab in the middle pane near
  the middle of the screen. If you expand out the Level and Date and
  Time Columns, you should see a bunch of errors and date and times that
  are 5 minutes apart. If that's the case, then this task is the
  problem.</li>
<li>On the rightmost pane, select Disable. </li>
<li>There may be more than one scheduled task like this, so you'd need to disable any or all that were causing problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>It may be better not to completely disable the updater but make it check less often than once a day, which seems over the top. You can not do that without using the Task Scheduler. Double-click the "ManifestUpdate" Name in the Task Scheduler to open the Properties window and select the Triggers tab, here you can use the "Edit..." button to set the task to run as [in]frequently as you like. This is what I have done:</p>

<p>Be warned that the next MySQL update you do decide to install might undo anything done directly in the Task Scheduler.</p>
