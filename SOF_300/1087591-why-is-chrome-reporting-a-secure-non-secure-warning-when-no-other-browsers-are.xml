<post><title>security - Why is Chrome reporting a secure / non secure warning when no other browsers aren't? - Stack Overflow</title><question><text><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When I go to our web site through HTTPS mode, Chome is reporting an error saying that the page contains secure and not secure items. However, I used Firebug, Fiddler, and HttpDebuggerPro, all which are telling me that everything is going through HTTPS. Is this a bug in Chrome?</p>
<p>Sorry but I'm unable to give out the actual URL.</p>

<p>A bit late to the party here but I've been having issues recently and once I had found a http resource and changed it was still getting the red padlock symbol.  When I closed the tab and opened a new one it changed to a green padlock so I guess Chrome caches this information for the lifetime of the tab</p>

<p>Current versions of Chrome will show the mixed content's URL in the error console.  Hit CTRL+Shift+J and you'll see text like:</p>
<p>"The page at <a href="https://www.fiddler2.com/test/securepageinsecureimage.htm" rel="noreferrer">https://www.fiddler2.com/test/securepageinsecureimage.htm</a> contains insecure content from <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/Eric/images/me.jpg" rel="noreferrer">http://www.fiddler2.com/Eric/images/me.jpg</a>."</p>

<p>I was having the same issue: Chromium showing the non-secure static files, but when everything was http://.</p>
<p>Just closing the current tab and re-opening the page in another new tab worked, so I think this is a Chromium/Chrome bug.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>It is possible that a non-secure URL is referenced but not accessed (e.g. the codebase for a Flash <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>Using Chrome, if you open up the Developer Tools (View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools) and bring up the Console and choose to filter to warnings, you'll see a list of offending URLs.</p>
<p>You'll see something like the following if you do have insecure content</p>
<pre><code>The page at https://mysite/ displayed insecure content from http://insecureurl.
</code></pre>
<p>For the best experience in finding the culprit, you'll want to start your investigation in a new tab.</p>

<p>I ran into this problem when Jquery was being executing a a few seconds after page load which added a class containing a non-secure image background. Chrome must continually to check for any non-secure resources to be loaded.  </p>
<p>See the code example below. If you had code like this, the green padlock is shown in Chrome for about 5 seconds until the deferred class is applied to the div.</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout(function() { 
    $("#some-div").addClass("deferred")
    }, 5000);


.deferred
{
    background: url(http://not-secure.com/not-secure.jpg"
}

<p>Check the source of the page for any external objects (scripts, stylesheets, images, objects) linked using <code>http://...</code> rather than <code>https://...</code> or a relative path. Change the links to use relative paths, or absolute paths without protocol, i.e. <code>href="/path/to/file"</code>.</p>
<p>If all that if fine, it could be something included from Javascript. For example, the Google Analytics code uses <code>document.write</code> to add a new script to the page, but it has code to check for HTTPS in case the calling page is secure:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www.");
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>On the release of Chrome version 53 on Windows, Google has changed the trust indications to initiate the circle-i. Afterward, Google has announced a new warning message will be issued when a website is not using HTTPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From  2017 January Start, Popular web browser Chrome will begin
  labeling HTTP sites as “Not Secure” [Which transmit passwords / ask
  for credit card details]</p>
