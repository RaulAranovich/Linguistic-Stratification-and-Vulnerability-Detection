<post><title>security - Lock-down iPhone/iPod/iPad so it can only run one app - Stack Overflow</title><question><text><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>We'd like to 'lock-down' an iPhone/iPod/iPad so that the user can only run one app (we've developed this app internally). I'm guessing we'd be looking at jailbreaking, and then replacing (?) the default Springboard app... </p>
<p>Can we do this? If so, how?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Rick posted a great answer below. You can download a copy of a mobileconfig file from the URL below, if you visit this URL on your iOS device Safari will prompt you to install the profile. Don't forget to reboot your device :)</em></p>

<p><strong>EDIT EDIT:</strong> brainray posted below and pointed out that there's a new feature in iOS 6 called 'guided access' that allows you to lock a device to a specific app. It's a pity this feature wasn't available a year ago -- would have saved us a bit of hassle :)</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>EDIT EDIT EDIT: iOS 7 now includes an 'App Lock' payload</strong> as part of the device configuration profile. From the Apple docs: <em>"By installing an app lock payload, the device is locked to a single application until the payload is removed. The home button is disabled, and the device returns to the specified application automatically upon wake or reboot."</em></p>

<p>It is possible to put an iPad or iPhone into 'Store Demo' mode so that the home button and swipe to home gesture is disabled. If you have seen the iPads in the Apple Store running the smart sign apps then you will know what I mean.</p>
<p>It is actually pretty trivial to make this work, all you need to do is install a correctly formatted mobile config plist over the air from a web server.</p>
<p>To deliver your config from the web all you have to do is direct the iPhone to a url containing the profile. Just open the link to your .mobileconfig file in safari. If you don't have web space you can just use dropbox public folder URLs or switch on your mac webserver.</p>
<p><strike>It's possible that you can load the config using IPCU too but I have not tried this.</strike> This config file will not load in the iPhone Configuration Utility as it uses keys that IPCU doesn't know about. You can combine this with whatever other enterprise configuration profiles you have in play.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <strong>@cocoanetics</strong> pointed out that IPCU is not required to remove the profile. However note that to get your device back to normal you would need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Open the settings app FIRST - don't open anything else or you will need to reboot again</li>
<li>Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Profiles-&gt;[your profile] remove it.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>
<p>you should be back to normal.</p>
<p>I have included an example plist that will disable the home button and lock your device into the app.</p>
<p><strong>BEWARE</strong></p>
<p><em>Once this profile is installed the first app that is launched when the device is rebooted will be the only app that will run until you reboot the device again.</em> 
As <strong>@Cawas</strong> has said this completely disables the ability to return to the home screen (unless your app crashes) including accessibility assistive touch.</p>
<p>Note that after installing the profile you must reboot the device (power off, power on) for it to take effect. To remove the profile plug the device into IPCU and delete it then reboot the device. Everything will be back to normal.</p>

<p>An alternative to the (admittedly much simpler) approach described by Rick is to:</p>

<li>disable the home button (e.g. physically covering it),</li>

<p>i found one way to quit this home-lock state.
i have install "backgrounder" via cydia which make your app run in background if you press home button for one second or more.
and now, when i longpress home button, i back to the home screen.</p>
<p>that is all.</p>

<p>Um- wasn't sure if this is an answer or a comment but - the solution that is now part of the question has a weakness - our support staff used this and found that if you "Tap the power button to ‘soft-off’ then hold the home button as you power on and slide to unlock. Sometimes iPad will start on the home page or else XXAPPLCATIONXX will hang and then drop out to the home page. Eitherway X is able to access the home page without the passcode."</p>

As Rick notes in his answer, all the provisioning profile does is disable the home button. Also, iPad will always start on the home screen when it is first powered on ;) (Whether the iPad has the provisioning profile installed or not.)</span></text><author><a class="comment-user owner" href="/users/336419/wpearse" title="1,554 reputation">wpearse</a></author></comment></comments></answer></answers></post>
